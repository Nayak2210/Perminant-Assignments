        Hi! I’m Rahul Nayak, a passionate B.Tech Computer Science student from AMTICS.

        I enjoy working on software development, building web applications, and diving deep into data structures.  
        React.js is my favorite frontend framework, and I’m constantly learning new skills to improve my craft.
